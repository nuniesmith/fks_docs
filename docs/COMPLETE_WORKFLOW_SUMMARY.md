# 🚀 Complete FKS Deployment Workflow

## 🎯 **Single Workflow Design**

The entire FKS deployment is now handled by **one complete workflow** (`00-complete.yml`) that orchestrates all stages automatically.

## 📋 **Workflow Stages**

### **🏗️ Stage 0: Server Creation + SSH Key Generation**
- Creates Linode server using `stage-0-create-server-with-ssh.sh`
- Immediately generates SSH keys for all users:
  - `root` - Administrative access
  - `jordan` - Primary user account  
  - `fks_user` - Service account for running FKS services
  - `actions_user` - GitHub Actions deployment account
- Sends Discord notification with `ACTIONS_USER_SSH_PUB`
- Saves server details for next stages

### **⏸️ Wait Period: Manual Secret Update**
- **5-minute timer** for manual `ACTIONS_USER_SSH_PUB` secret update
- Clear instructions displayed:
  1. Copy SSH key from Discord notification
  2. Go to GitHub repository settings → Secrets
  3. Update `ACTIONS_USER_SSH_PUB` secret
  4. Paste the new SSH public key
- **Options during wait:**
  - Cancel workflow and re-run after secret update
  - Wait for timer and auto-continue (uses password auth fallback)

### **🛠️ Stage 1: Server Initial Setup**
- Uses `stage-1-initial-setup.sh` with all required parameters
- Tests SSH key authentication first, falls back to password if needed
- Installs and configures:
  - Essential packages (Docker, Git, development tools)
  - User accounts with proper permissions
  - SSH keys for all users
  - Docker Hub authentication
  - Tailscale VPN preparation
  - Stage 2 systemd service setup
- Server reboots automatically to complete setup

### **🔄 Stage 2: Post-Reboot Configuration** 
- Runs automatically via systemd service after reboot
- Configures:
  - Tailscale VPN with provided auth key
  - iptables firewall rules
  - Final security hardening
- Creates completion marker: `/root/.fks-stage2-complete`

### **🧪 Stage 2 Verification**
- Waits 3 minutes for reboot completion
- Tests SSH connectivity and checks for completion marker
- 20 attempts with 30-second intervals (10-minute timeout)
- Reports final status: `completed`, `timeout`, or `unknown`

## 📊 **Status Reporting**

### **Discord Notifications:**
- **Stage 0**: SSH key generation with copy-ready key
- **Final Status**: Complete deployment summary with all stage results

### **Workflow Outputs:**
- `server_ip` - Public IP address of created server
- `server_id` - Linode server ID  
- `server_created` - Whether a new server was created
- `actions_user_ssh_pub` - Generated SSH public key
- `stage1_status` - Stage 1 completion status
- `stage2_status` - Stage 2 verification result

## 🎯 **Usage Instructions**

### **Automatic Deployment:**
1. Run the workflow (manual trigger or push to main)
2. Wait for Discord notification with SSH key
3. Update GitHub secret `ACTIONS_USER_SSH_PUB` within 5 minutes
4. Workflow continues automatically through all stages
5. Server ready for application deployment

### **Manual Intervention Option:**
1. Run workflow → Gets SSH key alert
2. Cancel workflow  
3. Update GitHub secret `ACTIONS_USER_SSH_PUB`
4. Re-run workflow → Uses updated SSH keys

## ✅ **Expected Final State**

After successful completion:
- ✅ Server created and fully configured
- ✅ All users (root, jordan, fks_user, actions_user) with SSH access
- ✅ Docker and development environment ready
- ✅ Tailscale VPN configured
- ✅ Firewall properly configured
- ✅ SSH key authentication working for GitHub Actions
- ✅ Ready for application deployment

## 🔧 **Technical Features**

- **Robust Error Handling**: Proper cleanup on failures
- **Smart Authentication**: SSH key testing with password fallback
- **Status Verification**: Multi-stage completion checking
- **DNS Updates**: Automatic Cloudflare DNS record updates
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed status reporting throughout

The workflow is now **production-ready** and handles the complete server lifecycle from creation to deployment-ready state! 🎉

# Pre-flight Checks Fix Summary

## ðŸš¨ Issue Identified
The pre-flight checks were failing because they depended on tools (`jq`, `bc`) that might not be available on the self-hosted runner environment.

## ðŸ”§ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Added Tool Installation Step**
- Added automatic installation of required tools (`jq`, `bc`)
- Support for multiple package managers (pacman, apt-get, yum)
- Verification step to confirm tool availability

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added `continue-on-error: true` to cache management
- Skip cache management if essential tools are not available
- Better error messages and fallback behaviors

### 3. **Improved Cache Management**
- More robust JSON parsing with proper error handling
- Fallback values when calculations fail
- Graceful degradation when tools are missing

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Behavior
The pre-flight checks should now:
1. âœ… Install required tools automatically
2. âœ… Skip non-essential steps if tools are unavailable
3. âœ… Continue with deployment even if cache management fails
4. âœ… Provide clear error messages and status updates

## ðŸš€ Ready for Testing
The workflow should now pass the pre-flight checks and proceed to the deployment phase.

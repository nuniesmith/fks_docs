# Linode Server Deployment Fix

## Issue Identified

The GitHub Actions workflow was not creating the Linode server because of incorrect boolean handling in the workflow conditions.

### Problems Fixed:

1. **Boolean Input Handling**: 
   - **Wrong**: `github.event.inputs.create_new_server == 'true'` (string comparison)
   - **Fixed**: `github.event.inputs.create_new_server == true` (boolean comparison)

2. **Missing Auto-Deploy Logic**: 
   - Added automatic infrastructure provisioning for pushes to main branch
   - Added fallback for non-manual workflow triggers

3. **Added Debug Information**: 
   - Added debug step to show condition evaluation
   - Helps troubleshoot future deployment issues

## Fixed Conditions

### Infrastructure Provisioning (`provision-infrastructure` job)
**Now runs when**:
- Manual workflow with `deployment_mode: 'full-deploy'`
- Manual workflow with `deployment_mode: 'infra-only'` 
- Manual workflow with `create_new_server: true` (boolean)
- **OR** automatic push to main branch

### Application Deployment (`deploy-application` job)
**Now runs when**:
- Manual workflow with `deployment_mode: 'full-deploy'`
- Manual workflow with `deployment_mode: 'deploy-only'`
- **OR** automatic push to main branch
- **AND** builds succeeded OR builds were skipped
- **AND** infrastructure succeeded OR was skipped

## How to Deploy Server Now

### Option 1: Manual Workflow (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub Actions ‚Üí "FKS Trading Systems - Optimized Deployment Pipeline"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select:
   - **Deployment mode**: `full-deploy`
   - **Create new server**: ‚úÖ **Check this box**
   - **Environment**: `development` (or your preference)
4. Click "Run workflow"

### Option 2: Push to Main Branch
- Simply push changes to the main branch
- The workflow will automatically create infrastructure and deploy

### Option 3: Infrastructure Only
1. Go to GitHub Actions ‚Üí "Run workflow"
2. Select:
   - **Deployment mode**: `infra-only`
   - **Create new server**: ‚úÖ **Check this box**
3. This will only create the server without deploying

## Expected Results

When the workflow runs successfully:

1. **üèóÔ∏è Provision Infrastructure** job will:
   - Show debug information about condition evaluation
   - Create new Linode server `fks-dev` in Toronto, Canada
   - Install all dependencies via StackScript
   - Output server IP address

2. **üèóÔ∏è Build** jobs will:
   - Build Docker images for API, Worker, Web, Nginx
   - Push images to Docker Hub

3. **üöÄ Deploy Application** job will:
   - SSH to the new server
   - Clone the repository
   - Start Docker Compose services
   - Verify deployment success

## Server Specifications

- **Name**: `fks-dev`
- **Hostname**: `fks`
- **Location**: Toronto, Canada (`ca-central`)
- **Type**: `g6-standard-2` (4GB RAM, 2 CPUs)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04
- **Backups**: Enabled

## Debugging

The workflow now includes debug output showing:
- Event type (push, workflow_dispatch, etc.)
- Input values for manual workflows
- Condition evaluation results

This will help identify why infrastructure provisioning might be skipped in future runs.

## Next Steps

1. **Commit these changes** to your repository
2. **Run the workflow manually** with `full-deploy` mode and `create_new_server: true`
3. **Monitor the logs** for the debug information and server creation progress
4. **Note the server IP** from the workflow output for future use

The workflow should now properly create your Linode server and deploy the FKS Trading Systems!

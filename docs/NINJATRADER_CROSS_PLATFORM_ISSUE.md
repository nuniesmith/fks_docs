# NinjaTrader 8 Cross-Platform DLL Compatibility Issue

## Problem Identified

The **"Object reference not set to an instance of an object"** error when importing DLL-based packages into NinjaTrader 8 is caused by **cross-platform compatibility issues** between:

- **Linux Build Environment**: Using Mono/.NET on Linux
- **NinjaTrader 8 Runtime**: Expecting Windows .NET Framework 4.8 assemblies

## Evidence

```bash
$ file TestLib.dll
TestLib.dll: PE32 executable (DLL) (console) Intel 80386 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS Windows, 3 sections
```

Even minimal test libraries built on Linux are marked as **"Mono/.Net assembly"** which causes import failures in NinjaTrader 8.

## Solutions Available

### ✅ Solution 1: Source-Code-Only Import (RECOMMENDED)

**Package**: `FKS_SourceOnly_Package.zip`

- Contains **pure source code** only
- No DLL dependencies
- NinjaTrader 8 compiles the code natively on Windows
- **Avoids cross-platform issues entirely**
- Tested and working in previous iterations

### ⚠️ Solution 2: Windows-Based Build (Future Enhancement)

To produce compatible DLLs, the build process would need to run on Windows with native .NET Framework 4.8:

#### Option A: Windows Build Machine
- Set up Windows CI/CD runner
- Build with native .NET Framework 4.8
- Produces Windows-compatible DLLs

#### Option B: Windows Cross-Compilation
- Investigate advanced .NET Framework targeting from Linux
- May require specific MSBuild configurations
- Not guaranteed to work

### ❌ Current Linux Build Limitations

Building .NET Framework 4.8 assemblies on Linux using Mono produces assemblies that are technically correct but have compatibility markers that cause issues with NinjaTrader 8's assembly loading system.

## Recommendation

**Use the source-code-only approach** (`FKS_SourceOnly_Package.zip`) as it:

1. ✅ **Works reliably** with NinjaTrader 8
2. ✅ **Avoids cross-platform issues** entirely  
3. ✅ **Maintains all functionality** of the FKS system
4. ✅ **Compiles natively** on the target Windows system
5. ✅ **No performance overhead** compared to pre-compiled DLLs

## Testing Priority

1. **Test**: `FKS_SourceOnly_Package.zip` (should work)
2. **Compare**: Previous source-only imports (for validation)
3. **Future**: Consider Windows build pipeline for DLL distribution if needed

## Files Created

- `FKS_SourceOnly_Package.zip` - Source-only FKS package (recommended)
- `TestLib_Package.zip` - Minimal test DLL (demonstrates issue)
- `TestLib_Windows_Package.zip` - Windows-targeted test DLL (still has issue)
- `FKS_TradingSystem_v1.0.0.zip` - Full DLL package (has compatibility issue)

The source-only approach is the most reliable solution for cross-platform development targeting NinjaTrader 8.

# Stage 1 Fix Applied âœ…

## Issue Found
The Stage 1 step had an incorrect condition:
```yaml
if: env.stage1_completed == 'true'
```

This was **backwards logic** - it was saying "only run Stage 1 if Stage 1 is already completed", which makes no sense!

## Fix Applied
Changed the condition to:
```yaml
if: steps.stage0.result == 'success' && steps.stage0.outputs.server_ip != ''
```

This correctly says: "Run Stage 1 only if Stage 0 was successful AND we have a server IP"

## How Stage Process Should Work Now

1. **Stage 0**: Create/detect server, generate SSH keys âœ…
2. **Send Discord notification** with SSH key âœ…  
3. **Stage 1**: Run immediately after Stage 0 success âœ…
   - Create 3 users (jordan, fks_user, actions_user)
   - Set passwords from GitHub Secrets
   - Configure SSH keys
   - Install packages
   - Create Stage 2 systemd service
   - **Reboot server**
4. **Stage 2**: Runs automatically after reboot via systemd
   - Configure Tailscale
   - Setup firewall
   - Mark completion

## What Was Wrong Before
- Stage 1 never ran because the condition was impossible to meet
- Server was created but never configured
- No users were created
- No Stage 2 service was set up

## What Will Happen Now
- Stage 1 will run immediately after Stage 0 completes
- All 3 users will be created with secure passwords
- SSH keys will be properly configured
- Server will reboot and Stage 2 will run automatically
- Complete server setup will finish properly

The workflow should now work end-to-end! ðŸš€

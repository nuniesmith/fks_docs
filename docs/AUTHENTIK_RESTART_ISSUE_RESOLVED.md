# Authentik Restart Issue - RESOLVED âœ…

## Problem Diagnosed
The `fks_authelia_worker` container was stuck in a restart loop due to a database migration failure:

```
psycopg.errors.UndefinedTable: relation "authelia_tenants_tenant" does not exist
```

## Root Cause
- Incomplete database migration from a previous Authentik startup
- Database tables were partially created but missing critical tables required by newer migration scripts
- This created a migration deadlock where the system couldn't proceed

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Stopped Authentik Services**
```bash
docker compose stop authelia-server authelia-worker
```

### 2. **Reset Database Schema**
```bash
docker exec -it fks_authelia_db psql -U authelia -d authelia -c "DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;"
```

### 3. **Restarted Services for Fresh Migration**
```bash
docker compose up -d authelia-server authelia-worker
```

## Current Status âœ…

### **Authentik Services**
- âœ… **fks_authelia_server**: Running and healthy (HTTP 200 on port 9000)
- âœ… **fks_authelia_worker**: Running and stable (no more restarts)
- âœ… **fks_authelia_db**: Healthy with fresh schema
- âœ… **fks_authelia_redis**: Healthy and connected

### **Web Services**
- âœ… **React App**: Running on port 3000 (Docker container)
- âœ… **React Dev Server**: Running on port 3001 (for authentication testing)
- âœ… **API Service**: Healthy on port 8000
- âœ… **All other services**: Running normally

## Authentication Setup Ready for Testing

### **Available Authentication Methods**
1. **ðŸ”’ Primary: Authentik** (http://localhost:9000)
   - Open source SSO
   - Passkey support
   - Self-hosted privacy

2. **ðŸ”— Alternative: Google OAuth**
   - fks-trading-systems project configured
   - fks-calendar project configured
   - Ready for testing with real credentials

### **Environment Configuration**
Your `.env` file is properly configured with:
- âœ… Authentik database credentials
- âœ… Google OAuth client IDs for both projects
- âœ… Correct redirect URIs
- âœ… All required secrets

## Next Steps for Testing

### 1. **Test Authentik Authentication**
```bash
# Access Authentik admin interface
curl http://localhost:9000/if/admin/
# Expected: HTTP 200 âœ…
```

### 2. **Test React Application**
```bash
# Access React app with authentication
http://localhost:3001
# Should show AuthenticationSelector component
# Authentik should be the primary option
```

### 3. **Complete Google Setup** (when ready)
- Add real Google OAuth credentials to `.env`
- Test both authentication flows
- Verify admin role assignment for your email

## Lessons Learned

### **Database Migration Issues**
- Always check for incomplete migrations when containers restart
- Database schema corruption can cause persistent restart loops
- Fresh schema reset is often faster than attempting partial repairs

### **Container Dependencies**
- Authentik worker depends on successful database migration
- Server and worker must both complete migrations before becoming healthy
- Health checks may take time even when service is functional

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps | grep authelia

# Check logs if issues recur
docker logs fks_authelia_worker --tail 50
docker logs fks_authelia_server --tail 50

# Test service health
curl -f http://localhost:9000/if/admin/
```

**Authentik is now fully operational and ready for your authentication testing!** ðŸŽ‰

# Phase 3 Integration Status (Auto-Generated Summary)

## Overview

Consolidated status after implementing dynamic compose generation, E2E smoke, backtest placeholder, and CI workflow.

## Key Components Implemented

- Submodules integrated across services (shared-* repos).
- Language path/dependency adjustments (Python sitecustomize, Rust path deps, TS path alias).
- Shared Dockerfile leveraged via `generate_compose.sh` with profiles (minimal/core/full).
- `e2e_compose_smoke.sh` enhanced for generation, health waits, teardown.
- `backtest_e2e.sh` orchestrated via compose (core profile) with placeholder endpoint validation.
- Integration script now invokes compose smoke optionally.
- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) running integration, compose smoke, backtest placeholder, summarizing results.

## Remaining Gaps / Next Steps

1. Real backtest endpoint: replace placeholder `/api/status` with `/backtests/run` (or similar) plus payload & polling for completion.
2. Service images optimization: add build cache strategy (actions/cache for cargo, pip, node) and multi-arch builds if needed.
3. Tag & release pipeline: integrate `tag_shared_repos.sh` post successful main build; attach SBOM & provenance.
4. Production compose generation: extend generator to emit volumes, networks, secrets stanzas from canonical `docker-compose.yml` for full profile.
5. Observability validation: add Prometheus/Grafana health + scrape target presence assertions in full profile smoke.
6. Security scanning: add Trivy / Grype job to scan generated images before release.
7. Backtest result artifact: capture JSON result & store as workflow artifact for inspection.
8. Cleanup & archival: add README pointer to archived monolith docs and mark deprecated scripts.

## Quick Command Reference

Run integration (including compose smoke):

```bash
cd fks_master/scripts && bash integration_test.sh
```

Skip compose:

```bash
bash integration_test.sh --skip-compose
```

Generate full compose:

```bash
bash generate_compose.sh --profile full --force --print
```

E2E compose smoke (core profile, keep stack):

```bash
bash e2e_compose_smoke.sh --profile core --generate --no-teardown
```

Backtest placeholder:

```bash
bash backtest_e2e.sh --profile core
```

## Validation Summary

All scripts executed locally with syntax validation; dynamic compose validated via `docker compose config` for minimal profile in generation path. CI workflow added (pending first run in repo). No lint/test failures introduced in modified scripts.

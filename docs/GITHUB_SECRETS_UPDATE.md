# FKS GitHub Secrets Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow (00-default.yml)

**Problem**: SSH keys were being added to deployment.env without proper quoting, causing shell interpretation errors.

**Fix**: Updated the "Create deployment environment file" step to properly quote all SSH keys:

```yaml
# Before (causing errors):
echo 'ACTIONS_JORDAN_SSH_PUB=${{ secrets.ACTIONS_ACTIONS_JORDAN_SSH_PUB }}' >> deployment.env

# After (properly quoted):
echo 'ACTIONS_JORDAN_SSH_PUB="${{ secrets.ACTIONS_ACTIONS_JORDAN_SSH_PUB }}"' >> deployment.env
```

**Added**: 
- Environment file format fixing step using fix-env-file.sh
- Debug step to show environment structure (without sensitive values)
- Better error handling and validation

### 2. Improved deploy-full.sh Script

**Enhanced**: Environment file validation with better error messages and suggestions:
- Detects unquoted SSH keys
- Provides clear fixing instructions
- Suggests using the fix-env-file.sh script

### 3. Enhanced fix-env-file.sh Script

**Improved**: Now handles more cases:
- SSH public keys (SSH_PUB variables)
- SSH private keys (SSH_KEY variables)
- Any values with spaces that need quoting
- Creates backups before fixing
- Validates syntax after fixing

### 4. Created deployment.env.example

**Added**: Complete example configuration file showing proper format for all variables including quoted SSH keys.

## Your GitHub Secrets

Based on your secrets list, here's the mapping:

| GitHub Secret | Environment Variable | Purpose |
|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| `ACTIONS_ACTIONS_JORDAN_SSH_PUB` | `ACTIONS_JORDAN_SSH_PUB` | Jordan's SSH public key |
| `ACTIONS_FKS_SSH_PUB` | `ACTIONS_USER_SSH_PUB` | FKS user SSH public key |
| `ACTIONS_ROOT_SSH_PUB` | `ACTIONS_ROOT_SSH_PUB` | Root SSH public key |
| `ACTIONS_USER_SSH_PUB` | `ACTIONS_FKS_SSH_PUB` | Additional user SSH key |
| `ACTIONS_ROOT_PRIVATE_KEY` | `GITHUB_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key for git clone |
| `LINODE_CLI_TOKEN` | `LINODE_CLI_TOKEN` | Linode API access |
| `FKS_DEV_ROOT_PASSWORD` | `FKS_DEV_ROOT_PASSWORD` | Root password for new servers |
| `JORDAN_PASSWORD` | `JORDAN_PASSWORD` | Jordan user password |
| `FKS_USER_PASSWORD` | `FKS_USER_PASSWORD` | FKS user password |
| `TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY` | `TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY` | Tailscale VPN authentication |
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | `DOCKER_USERNAME` | Docker Hub username |
| `DOCKER_TOKEN` | `DOCKER_TOKEN` | Docker Hub access token |
| `NETDATA_CLAIM_TOKEN` | `NETDATA_CLAIM_TOKEN` | Netdata monitoring token |
| `NETDATA_CLAIM_ROOM` | `NETDATA_CLAIM_ROOM` | Netdata room ID |

## What This Fixes

1. **SSH Key Quoting**: All SSH keys are now properly quoted in the environment file
2. **Syntax Validation**: Environment files are validated and auto-fixed if needed
3. **Better Error Messages**: Clear instructions when environment file issues occur
4. **Automatic Recovery**: fix-env-file.sh can automatically resolve common issues

## Next Steps

1. **Push these changes** to your repository
2. **Trigger the workflow** - it should now work without the SSH key parsing error
3. **Monitor the deployment** - the debug step will show you the environment structure

## Testing Locally

If you want to test locally:

```bash
# Copy the example and fill in your values
cp scripts/deployment/staged/deployment.env.example deployment.env

# Edit with your actual values
nano deployment.env

# Fix any formatting issues
./scripts/deployment/staged/fix-env-file.sh deployment.env

# Run deployment
./scripts/deployment/staged/deploy-full.sh --env-file deployment.env
```

The main issue was that SSH keys containing spaces and special characters need to be quoted in shell environment files, and the GitHub Actions workflow wasn't doing this properly. Now it is!

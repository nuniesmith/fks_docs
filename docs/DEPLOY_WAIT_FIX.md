# Deploy Application Wait/Retry Fix Applied ✅

## Problem Identified
The deploy-application job was failing because it was running too early while the server was still:
- Rebooting from Stage 1 
- Running Stage 2 setup via systemd
- Completing Tailscale and firewall configuration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Wait/Retry Step
New step: **"⏳ Wait for Server Setup Completion"**
- Waits up to 5 minutes (5 attempts, 1 minute apart)
- Tests multiple readiness indicators:
  - SSH port 22 connectivity 
  - SSH authentication success
  - Stage 2 completion marker file

### 2. Enhanced Deploy Services Step
- Only runs if wait step succeeds
- Added condition: `if: steps.wait-for-server.outcome == 'success'`

### 3. Increased Timeout
- Changed job timeout from 20 to 30 minutes
- Accounts for up to 5 minutes of waiting + deployment time

## How It Works Now

```yaml
deploy-application:
  steps:
    1. 🎯 Determine Target Host
    2. ⏳ Wait for Server Setup Completion  # NEW
       - Test SSH connectivity
       - Test SSH authentication  
       - Check Stage 2 completion marker
       - Retry every 60 seconds for up to 5 minutes
    3. 🚀 Deploy Services  # Only if wait succeeds
       - Run deployment script
```

## Readiness Tests

The wait step performs these checks:

1. **Port Check**: `nc -z $TARGET_HOST 22`
   - Ensures SSH service is running

2. **SSH Auth Check**: `sshpass ssh root@$TARGET_HOST "echo test"`
   - Ensures SSH authentication works

3. **Stage 2 Check**: `test -f /root/.fks-stage2-complete`
   - Ensures Stage 2 systemd service has finished

## Expected Timeline

```
Stage 1 completes → Server reboots → Stage 2 runs → Deploy waits → Deploy runs
     ↓                   ↓              ↓             ↓            ↓
  (immediate)         (30-60s)       (60-120s)    (0-300s)    (normal)
```

## Error Handling

If server isn't ready after 5 minutes:
- Provides diagnostic information
- Shows possible issues
- Suggests manual troubleshooting
- Fails deployment gracefully

The deploy-application job should now handle server timing issues properly! 🚀

# Step Condition Fix Applied ✅

## Root Cause Identified
The issue was that Stage 1 was trying to check `steps.stage0.result` **from within the same job**. In GitHub Actions, you can't check a step's `result` from within the same job while it's still running.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Stage 1 Condition (Fixed)
**Before:**
```yaml
if: steps.stage0.result == 'success' && steps.stage0.outputs.server_ip != ''
```
❌ **Problem:** Can't check `steps.stage0.result` from same job

**After:**
```yaml
if: always() && steps.stage0.outputs.server_ip != ''
```
✅ **Solution:** Just check if Stage 0 produced a server IP output

### 2. Stage 1 Complete Condition (Fixed)
**Before:**
```yaml
if: steps.stage1.result == 'success'
```
❌ **Problem:** Can't check `steps.stage1.result` from same job

**After:**
```yaml
if: always() && env.stage1_completed == 'true'
```
✅ **Solution:** Check environment variable set by Stage 1

## How It Works Now

```yaml
provision-infrastructure:  # Single Job
  steps:
    - name: "🚀 Stage 0: Create/Detect Server"
      id: stage0
      # Creates server and sets outputs
      
    - name: "📢 Send Discord Notification"
      if: always() && steps.stage0.outputs.actions_user_ssh_pub != ''
      # Sends notification with SSH key
      
    - name: "🛠️ Stage 1: Server Initial Setup"
      if: always() && steps.stage0.outputs.server_ip != ''  # ✅ NOW WORKS
      # Runs Stage 1 setup and sets env.stage1_completed=true
      
    - name: "✅ Stage 1 Complete - Server Ready"
      if: always() && env.stage1_completed == 'true'  # ✅ NOW WORKS
      # Confirms Stage 1 completion
```

## Expected Flow Now
1. ✅ Stage 0 runs and creates server
2. ✅ Discord notification sent with SSH key  
3. ✅ **Stage 1 will now run** (condition fixed!)
4. ✅ Stage 1 sets `env.stage1_completed=true`
5. ✅ Stage 1 completion step runs
6. ✅ Server reboots and Stage 2 runs via systemd

The workflow should now execute all steps properly! 🚀

# Discord Notification Fix - Complete

## Issue Identified
The GitHub Actions workflow had an inconsistent Discord webhook configuration that prevented notifications from being sent properly.

## Problem Details
In the final deployment completion notification step, the workflow was incorrectly configured:
- Environment variable was named `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` 
- But was trying to get value from non-existent secret `secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`
- Should have been using `secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SERVERS` (which exists)

## Fix Applied
**File**: `.github/workflows/00-complete.yml`

**Changes Made**:
1. **Line ~863**: Changed environment variable from `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` to `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SERVERS`
2. **Line ~863**: Changed secret reference from `secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` to `secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SERVERS`
3. **Line ~868**: Updated conditional check to use `$DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SERVERS`
4. **Line ~877**: Updated curl command to use `$DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SERVERS`

## Before (Broken)
```yaml
- name: üì¢ Send completion notification
  env:
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL }}  # ‚ùå Wrong secret
    TARGET_IP: ${{ needs.initial-setup.outputs.target_ip }}
  run: |
    if [ -z "$DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL" ]; then                   # ‚ùå Wrong variable
      echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Discord webhook not configured, skipping notification"
      exit 0
    fi
    # ...
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"content\": \"$MESSAGE\"}" "$DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"  # ‚ùå Wrong variable
```

## After (Fixed)
```yaml
- name: üì¢ Send completion notification
  env:
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SERVERS: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SERVERS }}  # ‚úÖ Correct secret
    TARGET_IP: ${{ needs.initial-setup.outputs.target_ip }}
  run: |
    if [ -z "$DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SERVERS" ]; then                       # ‚úÖ Correct variable
      echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Discord webhook not configured, skipping notification"
      exit 0
    fi
    # ...
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"content\": \"$MESSAGE\"}" "$DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SERVERS"  # ‚úÖ Correct variable
```

## Verification Completed
- ‚úÖ YAML syntax validation passed
- ‚úÖ All Discord notifications now use `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SERVERS` consistently
- ‚úÖ No references to the old `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` remain
- ‚úÖ All required secrets are properly integrated

## Discord Notifications in Workflow
The workflow now sends Discord notifications at two key points:

1. **SSH Keys Generated** (`notify-keys` job):
   - Sent when server setup completes and SSH keys are generated
   - Includes server IP and access instructions
   - Uses `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SERVERS` secret ‚úÖ

2. **Deployment Complete** (`final-health-check` job):
   - Sent when entire deployment pipeline completes successfully  
   - Includes server status and access URLs
   - Uses `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SERVERS` secret ‚úÖ

## Impact
- Discord notifications will now work correctly
- Both setup completion and deployment completion messages will be sent
- Notifications provide server IP, access methods, and status updates
- No more "Discord notification failed" errors due to missing webhook URL

## Next Steps
The workflow is now fully configured and ready for end-to-end testing. All secrets are properly integrated and Discord notifications should work correctly.

# 🎯 SOLUTION FOUND: AdditionalReferences.txt Required!

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**

The **"Object reference not set to an instance of an object"** error was caused by a **missing AdditionalReferences.txt file**. According to the official NinjaTrader forum:

> **"If the DLL is a custom assembly, you must also include a text file named 'AdditionalReferences.txt' in the same root directory. This text file should list the names of all custom DLL assemblies, one name per line."**

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

Created corrected packages that include:

1. **FKS.dll** at root level ✅
2. **AdditionalReferences.txt** at root level ✅ **(THIS WAS MISSING!)**
3. **manifest.xml** and **Info.xml** at root level ✅
4. Source code in **bin/Custom/** folders ✅

### **AdditionalReferences.txt Content:**
```
FKS
```
*(Just the assembly name without .dll extension)*

## 📦 **Corrected Packages Ready for Testing**

### **1. Test_WithReferences_Package.zip** ⭐ **TEST THIS FIRST**
- **Simple test** with minimal DLL + AdditionalReferences.txt
- **Purpose**: Prove the fix works
- **Size**: 12KB

### **2. FKS_WithReferences_Package.zip** ⭐ **TEST SECOND** 
- **Complete FKS system** with AdditionalReferences.txt
- **Purpose**: Full working system
- **Size**: ~600KB

## 🎯 **Why This Matters**

From the NinjaTrader forum discussion:

- **Multiple DLL conflicts**: Without AdditionalReferences.txt, NT8 can't properly resolve custom assemblies
- **Assembly loading failures**: The import mechanism fails to reference custom DLLs correctly
- **"Object reference" errors**: These occur when NT8 can't find or load the custom assembly dependencies

## 📋 **Testing Priority**

1. **Test_WithReferences_Package.zip** - Simple proof of concept
2. **FKS_WithReferences_Package.zip** - Full FKS system

**Expected Result**: Both should now import successfully without errors! 🎉

## 🛠️ **Updated Build Process**

The main build script (`build-nt8-package.sh`) has been updated to **automatically include AdditionalReferences.txt** in all future builds.

---

**This was the missing piece all along!** The packages had correct structure, correct DLLs, correct source code - they just needed the **AdditionalReferences.txt file** to tell NinjaTrader 8 about the custom assembly dependency. 🗝️

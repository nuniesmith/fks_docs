## 🛑 STOP LOSS QUICK CALC

### Formula: Entry ± (ATR × Multipliers)

**Volatility Status Multiplier:**
- 🔴 HIGH = 0.8× (tighter stop)
- 🟡 MEDIUM = 1.0× (normal stop)
- 🟢 LOW = 1.2× (wider stop)

**Market Phase Bonus:**
- TREND = 1.5× (more room)
- ACCUMULATION = 1.2× (moderate room)
- RANGE = 0.8× (tight stop)

**Typical Stops:**
- GC: $5-10 ($500-1000 risk)
- NQ: 20-40 pts ($400-800 risk)
- CL: $0.30-0.50 ($300-500 risk)
- BTC: 1-2% of price

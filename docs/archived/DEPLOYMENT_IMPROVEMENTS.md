# FKS Trading Systems - Deployment Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the GitHub Actions deployment workflow and supporting scripts.

## üöÄ GitHub Actions Improvements

### Enhanced Deploy Application Job

The `deploy-application` job now includes:

1. **Multi-User SSH Fallback Strategy**
   - Tries `actions_user` first
   - Falls back to `jordan` user
   - Falls back to `fks_user` 
   - Last resort: `root` user with `FKS_DEV_ROOT_PASSWORD`

2. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive SSH connection testing
   - Better error messages and diagnostics
   - Graceful failure with detailed logging

3. **Enhanced Prerequisites**
   - Automatic installation of required tools (`sshpass`, `git`, `jq`)
   - System compatibility checks
   - Docker installation verification

4. **Improved Deployment Process**
   - Repository cloning with HTTPS/SSH fallback
   - Service startup with multiple methods (`start.sh` or `docker-compose`)
   - Health verification after deployment
   - Detailed service status reporting

5. **Better Logging and Monitoring**
   - Structured logging with timestamps
   - Error categorization
   - Diagnostic information collection

## üìú New Shell Scripts

### 1. Enhanced start.sh
- **Purpose**: Robust service startup with error handling
- **Features**:
  - Prerequisite checking (Docker, Docker Compose, disk space)
  - Environment file creation and validation
  - Service health verification
  - Colored logging output
  - Comprehensive error handling

### 2. restart.sh
- **Purpose**: Safe service restart capabilities
- **Features**:
  - Graceful service shutdown and restart
  - Individual service restart support
  - Status monitoring before and after restart
  - Quick health assessment

### 3. stop.sh
- **Purpose**: Clean service shutdown
- **Features**:
  - Graceful service termination
  - Optional Docker cleanup (`--clean` flag)
  - Individual service stop support
  - Resource cleanup options

### 4. health-check.sh
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive system health monitoring
- **Features**:
  - Service connectivity testing
  - Docker service status
  - System resource monitoring
  - Database connectivity checks
  - Recent log analysis

## üîê Security Improvements

1. **Password Management**
   - Secure password handling in SSH connections
   - No password exposure in logs
   - Proper environment variable usage

2. **SSH Configuration**
   - Optimized SSH settings for automation
   - Connection timeout and retry logic
   - Proper key handling

3. **File Permissions**
   - Correct permissions for sensitive files (.env, SSH keys)
   - Script executability management

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Manual Deployment**:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh              # Start all services
   ./health-check.sh       # Check system health
   ./restart.sh           # Restart all services
   ./restart.sh nginx     # Restart specific service
   ./stop.sh              # Stop all services
   ./stop.sh --clean      # Stop and cleanup
   ```

2. **Monitoring**:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps      # Check service status
   docker compose logs -f # Follow logs
   ./health-check.sh      # Full health check
   ```

### For GitHub Actions

The workflow now automatically:
- Installs required tools
- Tests multiple SSH connection methods
- Falls back to root user if needed
- Provides detailed error diagnostics
- Verifies deployment success

## üîß Configuration

### Required GitHub Secrets

**Primary Deployment Users**:
- `ACTIONS_USER_PASSWORD` - Dedicated deployment user
- `JORDAN_PASSWORD` - Regular user account
- `FKS_USER_PASSWORD` - Application user account

**Fallback**:
- `FKS_DEV_ROOT_PASSWORD` - Root access (last resort)

**Optional**:
- `DOMAIN_NAME` - Production domain
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` / `DOCKER_TOKEN` - Docker registry access

### Environment Variables

The `start.sh` script creates a default `.env` file with:
- Service port configurations
- Database credentials
- Security keys
- Monitoring settings

## üìä Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure deployment success
2. **Debuggability**: Detailed logging and error reporting
3. **Security**: Proper credential handling and secure defaults
4. **Maintainability**: Modular scripts for different operations
5. **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and status reporting

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Root Usage**: The system falls back to root only as a last resort
2. **Password Security**: All passwords are handled securely without exposure
3. **Service Health**: Deployment includes automatic health verification
4. **Error Recovery**: Failed deployments provide detailed diagnostic information

## üìã Next Steps

1. Test the improved deployment in a staging environment
2. Update GitHub secrets with appropriate user passwords
3. Monitor deployment logs for any remaining issues
4. Consider setting up dedicated deployment user accounts for better security

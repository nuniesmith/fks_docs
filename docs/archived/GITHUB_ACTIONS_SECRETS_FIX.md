# GitHub Actions Secrets Fix Summary

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Secrets Validation in Workflow

**Problem**: The workflow was failing because GitHub secrets were not being passed to the shell script environment properly.

**Solution**: 
- Added explicit `env` section to pass all secrets as environment variables
- Updated the secrets validation logic to handle different deployment modes
- Made validation context-aware (different secrets needed for different modes)

### 2. Improved Error Messages

**Problem**: Generic error messages didn't help users understand what was wrong.

**Solution**:
- Added descriptive messages for each missing secret
- Provided direct links to GitHub settings and documentation
- Added deployment mode-specific guidance

### 3. Added Graceful Degradation

**Problem**: Workflow failed completely even for code-only operations that don't need deployment secrets.

**Solution**:
- Allow `code-check-only` mode to run without any secrets
- Allow `builds-only` mode to run with just Docker Hub credentials
- Only require full secrets for actual deployment operations

### 4. Created Documentation

**Problem**: No guidance for users on how to set up the required secrets.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive `docs/GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- Includes step-by-step instructions for each secret
- Explains what each secret is used for
- Provides direct links to get the required values

## üìã Deployment Modes & Required Secrets

| Mode | Required Secrets | Purpose |
|------|------------------|---------|
| `code-check-only` | None | Run code quality checks only |
| `builds-only` | `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_TOKEN` | Build and push Docker images |
| `full-deploy` | All 7 core secrets | Complete deployment with infrastructure |
| `deploy-only` | All 7 core secrets | Deploy to existing infrastructure |
| `infra-only` | Infrastructure secrets | Create/update infrastructure only |

## üîê Core Required Secrets

1. **LINODE_CLI_TOKEN** - Linode API access
2. **FKS_DEV_ROOT_PASSWORD** - Server root password
3. **JORDAN_PASSWORD** - User account password
4. **FKS_USER_PASSWORD** - Application user password
5. **DOCKER_USERNAME** - Docker Hub username
6. **DOCKER_TOKEN** - Docker Hub access token
7. **TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY** - VPN authentication

## üöÄ How to Use

### For Development/Testing
```bash
# Run workflow in code-check mode (no secrets needed)
git push origin main
# Or manually trigger with "code-check-only" mode
```

### For Building Docker Images
```bash
# Configure these secrets first:
# - DOCKER_USERNAME
# - DOCKER_TOKEN
# Then run in "builds-only" mode
```

### For Full Deployment
```bash
# Configure all 7 core secrets first
# Then run in "full-deploy" mode
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Missing required secrets" error**
   - Check the workflow logs to see which specific secrets are missing
   - Go to GitHub repository settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions
   - Add the missing secrets using the setup guide

2. **Wrong deployment mode**
   - Use `code-check-only` for testing without secrets
   - Use `builds-only` if you only have Docker Hub credentials
   - Use `full-deploy` only when all secrets are configured

3. **Secrets validation passes but deployment fails**
   - Check that secret values are correct (not expired, have right permissions)
   - Verify network connectivity to external services
   - Check server logs for specific error messages

## üìñ Next Steps

1. **Set up basic secrets** for your deployment needs
2. **Review the setup guide** at `docs/GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
3. **Test with code-check-only mode** first
4. **Gradually add more secrets** as needed
5. **Monitor workflow runs** and check Discord notifications

This fix ensures the workflow can run in different contexts while providing clear guidance to users on what they need to configure for their specific use case.

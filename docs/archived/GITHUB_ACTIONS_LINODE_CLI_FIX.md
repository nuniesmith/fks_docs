# FKS Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with a Linode CLI error:
```
/tmp/linode-venv/bin/python: No module named linode_cli
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The Linode CLI was being installed correctly via `pip3 install --user linode-cli`
2. The PATH was being set correctly to include `$HOME/.local/bin`
3. However, the script was failing because:
   - Missing `jq` dependency for JSON parsing
   - No verification that the CLI was actually installed and working
   - The error message suggested a virtual environment issue

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Fixed Script
- **File**: `scripts/deployment/staged/stage-0-create-server-fixed.sh`
- **Improvements**:
  - Better error handling for Linode CLI installation
  - Multiple installation methods as fallback
  - Verification of CLI availability before use
  - Proper testing of CLI connection
  - Enhanced logging and error reporting

### 2. Updated Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/00-complete.yml`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `jq` installation (required for JSON parsing)
  - Added CLI installation verification
  - Better error messages for troubleshooting
  - The workflow now tries the fixed script first, then falls back to the original

### 3. Key Improvements

#### Script Improvements:
```bash
# Install CLI with proper error handling
if ! command -v linode-cli >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    log "Installing Linode CLI..."
    
    # Try multiple installation methods
    if pip3 install --user linode-cli --quiet 2>/dev/null; then
        log "‚úÖ Linode CLI installed via pip3 --user"
        export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
    elif pip3 install linode-cli --quiet 2>/dev/null; then
        log "‚úÖ Linode CLI installed via pip3 (system)"
    elif python3 -m pip install --user linode-cli --quiet 2>/dev/null; then
        log "‚úÖ Linode CLI installed via python3 -m pip --user"
        export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
    else
        error "Failed to install Linode CLI"
        exit 1
    fi
else
    log "‚úÖ Linode CLI already available"
fi
```

#### Workflow Improvements:
```yaml
# Install jq if needed
if ! command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  if command -v pacman >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    sudo -n pacman -S --noconfirm jq
  elif command -v apt-get >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    sudo -n apt-get install -y jq
  fi
fi

# Install Linode CLI with verification
echo "üì¶ Installing Linode CLI..."
pip3 install --user linode-cli --quiet
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
echo "PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" >> $GITHUB_ENV

# Verify installation
if command -v linode-cli >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "‚úÖ Linode CLI is available"
  linode-cli --version
else
  echo "‚ùå Linode CLI not found in PATH"
  echo "Available in ~/.local/bin: $(ls -la ~/.local/bin/ | grep linode || echo 'Not found')"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Testing
The fixed script has been tested locally and shows:
- Proper help output
- Correct argument parsing
- No syntax errors
- Executable permissions set correctly

## Deployment Strategy
The workflow now:
1. Tries the fixed script first: `stage-0-create-server-fixed.sh`
2. Falls back to original script if fixed version doesn't exist
3. Provides better error messages and debugging information

## Expected Outcome
The deployment should now:
- Successfully install and configure the Linode CLI
- Create or detect FKS servers properly
- Provide clear feedback on any remaining issues
- Continue with the rest of the deployment pipeline

## Next Steps
1. Run the workflow to test the fixes
2. Monitor the Stage 0 execution for any remaining issues
3. If successful, continue with Stage 1 (SSH setup) and subsequent stages

When the AO crosses above zero, it indicates bullish momentum.

Buy Entry Conditions (Long Trade Setup)

📌 We only take long trades when the price is near a strong support zone.

✅ Step 1: Identify Price Near Support

Watch for the candle to touch or come close above the solid lower band of the Top G indicator.
If the price stabilizes and forms a bullish rejection (like a pin bar or engulfing candle), prepare for a possible bounce.
✅ Step 2: Awesome Oscillator Bullish Confirmation

The AO crosses above zero, confirming bullish momentum.
✅ Step 3: Enter the Trade

Enter as soon as a bullish candle closes above support with AO confirmation.
🎯 Stop Loss & Take Profit
📌 Stop Loss — Place your stop below the recent swing low or the lower Top G band.
📌 Take Profit — First target at the middle band of Top G, second target at the dotted upper resistance.

Sell Entry Conditions (Short Trade Setup)

📌 We only take short trades when the price is near a strong resistance zone.

✅ Step 1: Identify Price Near Resistance

If the candle touches or crosses below the middle line of Top G, prepare for a potential reversal.
Look for a bearish rejection (e.g., pin bar, bearish engulfing candle).
✅ Step 2: Awesome Oscillator Bearish Confirmation

The AO crosses below zero, confirming bearish momentum.
✅ Step 3: Enter the Trade

Enter as soon as a bearish candle confirms the rejection at resistance.
🎯 Stop Loss & Take Profit
📌 Stop Loss — Place it above the recent swing high or the upper Top G band.
📌 Take Profit — First target at the middle band, second target at the solid lower support zone.

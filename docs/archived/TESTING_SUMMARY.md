# Stage 2 Resilience Testing Summary

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed hard Docker dependency** from Stage 2 systemd service
2. **Added 30-second boot delay** to let system settle
3. **Enhanced Docker error handling** with non-blocking fixes
4. **Made all Docker operations optional** - Stage 2 continues without Docker if needed
5. **Preserved critical functions** - Tailscale, SSH, repo cloning always run

## What Should Work Now

### After Reboot (Even with Docker Issues):
- ✅ Stage 2 service starts (won't fail due to Docker dependency)
- ✅ Tailscale gets installed and configured
- ✅ Repository gets cloned to `/home/ninja/ninja`
- ✅ SSH access remains available
- ✅ ninja user is properly configured
- ⚠️ Docker deployment may be skipped (with helpful error messages)

### Manual Recovery if Needed:
```bash
# Fix Docker manually
sudo systemctl start docker

# Run Docker deployment manually
cd /home/ninja/ninja
docker-compose up -d

# Or re-run Stage 2 manually
sudo /usr/local/bin/ninja-stage2.sh
```

## Testing Priority

**Most Important**: Verify that **Tailscale gets installed** even when Docker fails, ensuring remote access is maintained.

**Next Priority**: Confirm that Stage 2 service runs automatically after reboot and doesn't get blocked by Docker issues.

## Expected Log Messages

If Docker fails, you should see messages like:
- "Docker service not running - skipping Docker deployment"
- "You can manually start Docker later with: systemctl start docker"
- "Stage 2 will continue without Docker"
- "Tailscale and other services will still be configured"

This ensures the system remains accessible and manageable even when Docker has issues.

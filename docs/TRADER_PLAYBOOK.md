## CORE PRINCIPLES

### Trading Philosophy
- **Edge-Driven Approach**: Only trade setups with a statistically proven edge
- **Probabilistic Mindset**: Accept that any single trade can lose; focus on long-term edge

- **Sustainable Growth**: Target consistent compounding rather than outsized gains

### Risk Management Master Rules
1. **Maximum Capital Risk Per Trade**: 1% of total account value
2. **Maximum Daily Drawdown**: 3% of account value, stop trading upon reaching
3. **Maximum Monthly Drawdown**: 7% of account value, reduce position size by 50% at 5% drawdown
4. **Correlation Risk**: Maximum 3 correlated positions open simultaneously
5. **Risk-Reward Minimum**: 1:1.5 for scalps, 1:2 for intraday, 1:3 for swing trades
6. **Position Sizing Formula**:
   ```
   Position Size = (Account Size ร Risk Percentage) รท (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)
   ```
